===============================================
Code to solve for linear matter perturbations in
modified gravity where modifications are in the 
Geff(k,a)/G term
Hans A. Winther (2015) (hans.a.winther@gmail.com)
===============================================

* Define the data-type realT (double,float,...) in the Makefile

* Assumes for simplicity LCDM background (but can easily be changes)

* Specify Geff(k,a)/G and run.

* Outputs the ratio P_MG(k,a) / P_LCDM(k,a) for a given 'a'.

* All solve methods are contained in the header-file linear_pert_solver.h
     * Requires: ode_solver.h and spline.h (included here for simplicity)

* See main.cpp for examples of how to use it.
