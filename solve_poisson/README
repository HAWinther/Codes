Code to solve 3D Poisson-like equations using FFTW

===============================================

* Define the data-type realT (double,float,...) in the Makefile

* Requies FFTW3 library. Set up paths in Makefile.

* The equation to solve is D^2 Phi - m^2 Phi = S where S is a given source
  and 'm' is a constant. m = 0 by default. Change by calling set_massterm(mass)

* Assumes a periodic box with x,y,z in [0,1] so <S> = 0 is required for consistency

* All solve methods are contained in the header-file solve_poisson.h

* See main.cpp for examples of how to use it.
