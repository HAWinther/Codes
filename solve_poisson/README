Code to solve 3D Poisson-like equations using FFTW
Hans A. Winther (2015) (hans.a.winther@gmail.com)
===============================================

* Requires FFTW3 library.

* The equation to solve is D^2 Phi - m^2 Phi = S where S is a given source
  and 'm' is a constant. m = 0 by default. Change by calling set_mass(mass)
  If the Laplacian in the code-units has a different scaling, i.e.
                 D^2 = Ad^2/dx^2 + Bd^2/dx^2 + Cd^2/dx^2
  then one can change A,B,C (default = 1) by calling set_scalefactor(A,B,C)
  
* Assumes a periodic box with x,y,z in [0,1] so <S> = 0 is required for consistency

* All solve methods are contained in the header-file

* See main.cpp for examples of how to use it.
