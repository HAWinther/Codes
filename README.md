# Codes

Random codes that might be useful for other people.

Some of these codes are not properly tested and probably (definately) contain bugs...

* cmb_code [C++]: Object Oriented Boltzmann code for computing scalar C_l's for LCDM and other models. Works in the Newtonian Gauge.

* extract_paper_info_nasaads [Python]: Python script for extracting data about your articles (and articles that cite you) from the NASA ADS database. Outputs html with info about your papers and lets you know when new papers cite you.

* ode_solve [C++]: Simple code for solving coupled ordinary differential equations using RK4.

* qubic_spline [C++]: Simple class for making and using qubic splines.

* solve_poisson [C++]: Code for solving Poisson-like equations in 3D using FFTW.

* bin_ahf_profiles [C++]: Reads and does binning into mass-bins of a AHF_profiles halo catalog file.

* read_gagdet1 [C++]: Simple read methods for GADGET1 format.

* read_param_lua [C++] : Simple code for using LUA to write input files.
