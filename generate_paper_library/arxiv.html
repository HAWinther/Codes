<hr><h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03403">Inflation with an extra light scalar field after Planck</a></h2>
<p>
  <b>Authors:</b> Vincent Vennin ; Kazuya Koyama ; David Wands

  <b>Abstract:</b> Abstract: Bayesian inference techniques are used to investigate situations where an
additional light scalar field is present during inflation and reheating. This
includes (but is not limited to) curvaton-type models. We design a numerical
pipeline where $\simeq 200$ inflaton setups $\times\, 10$ reheating scenarios
$= 2000$ models are implemented and we present the results for a few
prototypical potentials. We find that single-field models are remarkably robust
under the introduction of light scalar degrees of freedom. Models that are
ruled out at the single-field level are not improved in general, because good
values of the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio can only be
obtained for very fine-tuned values of the extra field parameters and/or when
large non-Gaussianities are produced. The only exception is quartic large-field
inflation, so that the best models after Planck are of two kinds: plateau
potentials, regardless of whether an extra field is added or not, and quartic
large-field inflation with an extra light scalar field, in some specific
reheating scenarios. Using Bayesian complexity, we also find that more
parameters are constrained for the models we study than for their single-field
versions. This is because the added parameters not only contribute to the
reheating kinematics but also to the cosmological perturbations themselves, to
which the added field contributes. The interplay between these two effects lead
to a suppression of degeneracies that is responsible for having more
constrained parameters.

<h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03402">Recovering the Tidal Field in the Projected Galaxy Distribution</a></h2>
<p>
  <b>Authors:</b> David Alonso ; Boryana Hadzhiyska ; Michael A. Strauss
</p><p>
  <b>Abstract:</b> Abstract: We present a method to recover and study the projected gravitational tidal
forces from a galaxy survey containing little or no redshift information. The
method and the physical interpretation of the recovered tidal maps as a tracer
of the cosmic web are described in detail. We first apply the method to a
simulated galaxy survey and study the accuracy with which the cosmic web can be
recovered in the presence of different observational effects, showing that the
projected tidal field can be estimated with reasonable precision over large
regions of the sky. We then apply our method to the 2MASS survey and present a
publicly available full-sky map of the projected tidal forces in the local
Universe. As an example of an application of these data we further study the
distribution of galaxy luminosities across the different elements of the cosmic
web, finding that, while more luminous objects are found preferentially in the
most dense environments, there is no further segregation by tidal environment.
