  <b>Abstract:</b> Abstract: We investigate whether the predictions of single-field models of inflation
are robust under the introduction of additional scalar degrees of freedom, and
whether these extra fields change the potentials for which the data show the
strongest preference. We study the situation where an extra light scalar field
contributes both to the total curvature perturbations and to the reheating
kinematic properties. Ten reheating scenarios are identified, and all necessary
formulas allowing a systematic computation of the predictions for this class of
models are derived. They are implemented in the public library ASPIC, which
contains more than 75 single-field potentials. This paves the way for a
forthcoming full Bayesian analysis of the problem. A few representative
examples are displayed and discussed.
