      <b>Abstract:</b> We consider modified gravity models driven by a scalar field whose effects are screened in high density regions due to the presence of nonlinearities in its interaction potential and/or its coupling to matter. Our approach covers chameleon, f (R) gravity, dilaton and symmetron models and allows a unified description of all these theories. We find that the dynamics of modified gravity are entirely captured by the time variation of the scalar field mass and its coupling to matter evaluated at the cosmological minimum of its effective  ...

      <b>Abstract:</b> Scalar fields, strongly coupled to matter, can be present in nature and still be invisible to local experiments if they are subject to a screening mechanism. The symmetron is one such mechanism that relies on restoration of a spontaneously broken symmetry in regions of high density to shield the scalar fifth force. We have investigated structure formation in the symmetron model by using N-body simulations and find observable signatures in both the linear and nonlinear matter power spectrum and on the halo mass  ...

      <b>Abstract:</b> In chameleon dark energy models, local gravity constraints tend to rule out parameters in which observable cosmological signatures can be found. We study viable chameleon potentials consistent with a number of recent observational and experimental bounds. A novel chameleon field potential, motivated by f (R) gravity, is constructed where observable cosmological signatures are present both at the background evolution and in the growth rate of the perturbations. We study the evolution of matter density perturbations on  ...

      <b>Abstract:</b> Certain scalar-tensor theories exhibit the so-called chameleon mechanism, whereby observational signatures of scalar fields are hidden by a combination of self-interactions and interactions with ambient matter. Not all scalar-tensor theories exhibit such a chameleon mechanism, which has been originally found in models with inverse power runaway potentials and field-independent couplings to matter. In this paper we investigate field theories with field-dependent couplings and a power-law potential for the scalar field.  ...

A particular class of these scalar field theories include screening mechanisms intended to hide the scalar field below observational limits in the solar system, but not on galactic scales, where data still gives the freedom to find possible signatures of their presence. To make predictions to compare with observations coming from galactic and clusters scales (ie in the non-linear regime of  ...

      <b>Abstract:</b>  One century after its formulation, Einstein's general relativity has made remarkable predictions and turned out to be compatible with all experimental tests. Most (if not all) of these tests probe the theory in the weak-field regime, and there are theoretical and experimental reasons to believe that general relativity should be modified when gravitational fields are strong and spacetime curvature is large. The best astrophysical laboratories to probe strong-field gravity are black holes and neutron stars, whether isolated or in binary  ...

      <b>Abstract:</b> We investigate the environment dependence of dark matter halos in the symmetron modified gravity scenario. The symmetron is one of three known mechanisms for screening a fifth force and thereby recovering general relativity in dense environments. The effectiveness of the screening depends on both the mass of the object and the environment it lies in. Using high-resolution N-body simulations we find a significant difference, which depends on the halo's mass and environment, between the lensing and dynamical  ...

      <b>Abstract:</b> In chameleon field theories, a scalar field can couple to matter with gravitational strength and still evade local gravity constraints due to a combination of self-interactions and the couplings to matter. Originally, these theories were proposed with a constant coupling to matter; however, the chameleon mechanism also extends to the case where the coupling becomes field dependent. We study the cosmology of chameleon models with power-law couplings and power-law potentials. It is found that these generalized chameleons, when  ...

      <b>Abstract:</b>  Theories of modified gravity, in both the linear and fully non-linear regime, are often studied under the assumption that the evolution of the new (often scalar) degree of freedom present in the theory is quasi-static. This approximation significantly simplifies the study of the theory, and one often has good reason to believe that it should hold. Nevertheless it is a crucial assumption that should be explicitly checked whenever possible. In this paper we do so for the Vainshtein mechanism. By solving for the full spatial and time evolution of the  ...

We find that in high-density regions of space (such as deep inside dark matter halos) the value of α approaches the value measured on Earth. In the low-density outskirts of halos the scalar field value can approach the symmetry breaking value and  ...

In the absence of cold dark matter, the supersymmetron field converges to a supersymmetric minimum with a vanishing cosmological constant. When cold dark matter is present, the supersymmetron evolves to a matter-dependent minimum where its energy density does not vanish and could lead to the present acceleration of the Universe. The supersymmetron generates a short-ranged fifth  ...

      <b>Abstract:</b> The Layzer-Irvine equation describes energy conservation for a pressure less fluid interacting though quasi-Newtonian gravity in an expanding Universe. We here derive a Layzer-Irvine equation for scalar field theories where the scalar field is coupled to the matter fields, and show applications of this equation by applying it to N-body simulations of modified gravity theories. There it can be used as both a dynamical test of the accuracy of the solution and the numerical implementation when solving the equation of motion. We  ...

      <b>Abstract:</b> Self-consistent N-body simulations of modified gravity models are a key ingredient to obtain rigorous constraints on deviations from general relativity using large-scale structure observations. This paper provides the first detailed comparison of the results of different N-body codes for the f (R), Dvali–Gabadadze–Porrati and Symmetron models, starting from the same initial conditions. We find that the fractional deviation of the matter power spectrum from Λ cold dark matter agrees to better than 1 per cent up to k∼ 5–10 h Mpc− 1 between  ...

      <b>Abstract:</b> igate scalar-field theories with a field-dependent coupling to matter and show the existence of a chameleon mechanism. The thin-shell solutions for a spherical body are found, and used to investigate the consequences for the Eöt-Wash experiment, fifth-force searches and Casimir force experiments. Requiring that the scalar-field evades gravitational tests, we find that the coupling is sensitive to a mass-scale which is of order of the Hubble scale today. The background evolution is found to agree with LDCM, but the linear matter  ...
